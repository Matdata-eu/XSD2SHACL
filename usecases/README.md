# Use Cases

We conduct an analysis on two use cases by comparing our generated SHACL shapes with human-created SHACL shapes.

## RINF

Register of Infrastructure ([RINF](https://www.rinf-ch.ch))

We use the version 1.5 of [RINF XSD Schema](https://www.era.europa.eu/domains/registers/rinf_en) 
and version 2.6.3 of the [SHACL](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7775344)

## TED

Tenders Electronic Daily ([TED](https://ted.europa.eu))

We use the [Publication XSD](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/e-procurement/tedschemas)
and [SHACL shapes](https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping)

## Validation Metrics Results

Execute metrics.py under each folder to get validation results C_T, R/T, R/T', C_P, R/P, R/P'
